## 🧠 Reasoning Integration Architecture

### Core Concept: Systematic Decision-Making for Infrastructure

**Philosophy**: Complex infrastructure decisions require transparent, auditable reasoning. Every architectural choice, troubleshooting path, or migration strategy should be documented with clear logical steps.

### Integration Pattern

```
[Complex Infrastructure Problem]
         ↓
  [Sequential Thinking MCP]
    - Break down problem systematically
    - Test hypotheses
    - Document reasoning chain
    - Evaluate alternatives
         ↓
  [Domain-Specific Plugin]
    - Execute with documented rationale
    - Apply domain expertise
    - Validate against reasoning
         ↓
  [Auditable Solution + Decision Trail]
```

### Reasoning Use Cases for AD Messaging Engineers

#### 1. **Troubleshooting Complex Mail Flow Issues**
```bash
# User reports email delivery failures
/reasoning-troubleshoot "Exchange mail flow issue: emails to external domain not delivering"

# Sequential Thinking MCP activates:
# Thought 1: Identify symptoms and scope
# Thought 2: Analyze transport rule chain
# Thought 3: Check connector configuration
# Thought 4: Test hypothesis: connector authentication
# Thought 5: Validate fix approach
# → mail-flow-troubleshooter plugin executes with documented reasoning
```

#### 2. **Active Directory Architecture Design**
```bash
# Designing multi-site AD topology
/reasoning-design "Design AD site topology for 5 geographic locations with varying bandwidth"

# Sequential Thinking MCP guides:
# Thought 1: Analyze geographic distribution and network topology
# Thought 2: Evaluate replication requirements and schedules
# Thought 3: Consider failover and redundancy needs
# Thought 4: Calculate bandwidth requirements
# Thought 5: Design site link topology
# → site-topology-designer plugin implements with rationale
```

#### 3. **Exchange Hybrid Migration Planning**
```bash
# Planning Exchange hybrid deployment
/reasoning-plan-migration "Migrate 5000 mailboxes from Exchange 2016 to Exchange Online hybrid"

# Sequential Thinking MCP analyzes:
# Thought 1: Assess current environment and dependencies
# Thought 2: Evaluate migration approaches (cutover, staged, hybrid)
# Thought 3: Analyze risks for each approach
# Thought 4: Calculate timeline and resource requirements
# Thought 5: Design phased migration strategy
# Thought 6: Plan rollback procedures
# → exchange-hybrid-configurator executes with risk mitigation documented
```

#### 4. **Capacity Planning for AD Infrastructure**
```bash
# Scaling AD for growth
/reasoning-capacity-plan "Plan AD capacity for 50% user growth over 2 years"

# Sequential Thinking MCP evaluates:
# Thought 1: Analyze current utilization metrics
# Thought 2: Project growth patterns and workload
# Thought 3: Evaluate hardware/resource requirements
# Thought 4: Consider high availability needs
# Thought 5: Calculate cost implications
# → capacity-planning-toolkit implements with justifications
```

#### 5. **Security Compliance Remediation**
```bash
# Addressing security audit findings
/reasoning-security-remediate "Address 15 critical AD security findings from compliance audit"

# Sequential Thinking MCP prioritizes:
# Thought 1: Categorize findings by risk level
# Thought 2: Analyze dependencies between remediations
# Thought 3: Evaluate business impact of each fix
# Thought 4: Design remediation sequence
# Thought 5: Plan validation testing
# → ad-security-auditor implements with compliance documentation
```
